Pattern Strategy

A Strategy defines a set of algorithms that can be used interchangeably. 

Modes of transportation to an airport is an example of a Strategy. 

Several options exist such as:
    - driving one own car, 
    - taking a taxi, 
    - an airport shuttle, 
    - a city bus, 
    - a limousine service. 
For some airports are also available:
    - subways 
    - helicopters  

Any of these modes of transportation will get a traveler to the airport, and they can be used interchangeably.

The traveler must chose the Strategy based on tradeoffs between cost, convenience, and time
