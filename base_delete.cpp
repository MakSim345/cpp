In C++, "= 0" and "delete" are two different ways of specifying that a method is pure virtual and should not be implemented in the base class.

The "= 0" syntax is used in the method declaration in the base class to indicate that the method is pure virtual. For example:

class Base
{
public:
    virtual void myMethod() = 0;
};

In this example, the "virtual void myMethod() = 0;" line declares that "myMethod" is a pure virtual function that does not have an implementation in the base class. Any class that derives from "Base" must implement "myMethod" or it will also be an abstract class.

On the other hand, the "delete" keyword is used in the method definition to indicate that the method should not be callable. For example:

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
    void myMethod() override = delete;
};

In this example, the "override = delete" part of the method declaration for "myMethod" in the "Derived" class specifies that the implementation "myMethod" should be deleted. This means that if you try to call "myMethod" on an instance of "Derived", you will get a compile-time error.

In summary, "= 0" in the method declaration specifies that the method is pure virtual and must be implemented in any derived classes, while "delete" in the method definition specifies that the method should not be callable.

In C++ what is difference between "int a = 0;" and "int a{0};"?
In C++, both "int a = 0;" and "int a{0};" initialize the variable "a" to the value 0. However, there are some differences in how they behave in certain situations.

One difference is related to narrowing conversions. If you try to initialize a variable with a value that doesn't fit into its type, a narrowing conversion occurs. For example:

int a = 3.14;   // narrowing conversion
int b{3.14};    // error: narrowing conversion

In this example, the first line initializes "a" to the integer part of 3.14, which is 3. This is a narrowing conversion, but it's allowed in this case. The second line uses the brace initialization syntax with "b", but it results in a compile-time error, because "3.14" cannot be narrowed to an integer.

Another difference is related to the behavior when initializing aggregates (arrays and structs). When using brace initialization, you can initialize individual elements or members of an aggregate separately. For example:

int arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};    // array initialization
struct Point { int x, y; };
Point p = {1, 2};           // struct initialization
These are equivalent to the following brace initialization syntax:

int arr[3]{1, 2, 3};       // array initialization
Point p{1, 2};              // struct initialization
In summary, both "int a = 0;" and "int a{0};" initialize the variable "a" to the value 0, but brace initialization has some additional features related to narrowing conversions and aggregate initialization.
